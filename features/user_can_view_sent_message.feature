Feature: User can view sent message
    As a user
    In order to know what messages I have composed
    I want to view a sent page

    Background:
        Given the following user exist:
            | name   | email          | password | id |
            | dummy1 | user1@mail.com | password | 1  |
            | dummy2 | user2@mail.com | password | 2  |
        And I am logged in as "dummy1"
        And the inbox has content

    Scenario: To view sent message
        When I go to the sent page
        Then I should see "For ever yours"
        And I should see "Subject: To dear user2"
        And I should see "dummy1"
